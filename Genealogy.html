									<h2>What is Genealogy?</h2>
										<blockquote>Genealogy is the <b>study of families in generic and historic context.</b> Within that framework, it is the <b>study of the people who compose a family and the relationships among them.</b>  At the individual level, it is biography, because we must reconstruct each individual life in order to separate each person’s identity from that of others bearing the same name. Beyond this, many researchers also find that genealogy is a study of communities because kinship networks have long been the threads that create the fabric of each community’s social life, politics and economy (The Board of Certification of Genealogists, as cited in Dowell, 2011) .</blockquote>

									<h2>Background</h2>
										<p class="body"> Being half Irish and having an uncommon last name, Crocock, I have always been curious about where the surname might have originated from.</p>
										<p class="body">In 2019, while studying abroad in Ireland for my Erasmus year, I took a course at Technological University Dublin called "Ethnic and Roots Tourism" where you were required to build your family tree travelling back as far as you could. By the end of that course, I had found 28 direct family members and had gone back 6 generations.</p>
										<p class="body">I took such an interest in the subject that in 2020 I decided to choose “Roots Tourism in Ireland” as my dissertation topic for my Bachelor’s Degree in Tourism. As part of my dissertation, I tested out the free genealogy resources Ireland provided to the public. Through that project I was able to fill in some blanks and also find new individuals. At this moment in time the tree includes 36 direct members and goes back 7 generations.</p>
										<p class="body">Having been studying data analysis and visualisation through 2021 and wanting to put my knowledge to practice I decided to combine my interest for both fields by creating a database to store all my genealogy data and an interactive dashboard to map and visualise the movements of each individual within the family tree. Compiling and presenting the data in this way would facilitate future research and provide a dynamic tool for other family members to use to learn about their family history. </p>

									<h2>Tracing Irish Family History </h2>
										<p class="body">Tracing your Irish ancestry is said to be challenging and time consuming, particularly if you are using the free genealogical resources that are available. The main reasons for this are that the resources are not held centrally, they are to be found in different locations across the web and are controlled by various organizations, the records are not complete, and the quality varies depending on the counties or parishes they originated from. This makes it difficult for people to know where to start and where to go to get the information.</p>
										<p class="body">To trace my family, I used only the free resources Ireland provided. Firstly, because we learnt about some of those pages in class and used them throughout the course and, also, I wanted to test out the websites and see how far back I could get without having to pay or move from my computer. </p>
									<h4><b>Free Resources Used:</b></h4>
										<p class="red">The National Archives of Ireland</p>
											<p class="body"><span class="image left"><img src="images\National_Archives.png" alt="" /></span>The National Archives of Ireland has digitised and published on their website, <a href="http://www.census.nationalarchives.ie/">genealogy.nationalarchives.ie</a>, one of the most vital genealogical records, the 1901 and 1911 censuses. These censuses cover the entire population of the island's 32 counties and are the only surviving censuses in their entirety that are open to the public. Of the censuses carried out from 1821 to 1851, only fragments of some counties remain, but they can also be viewed on the site.</p>
											<p class="body"> The censuses are divided into four forms and collect a wealth of information. In the first form, 'Form A' , you can find out a person's first and last name, their age, sex, occupation, marital status, position in the family, how many children they had both living and deceased, religion, the county, town or country where they were born, where they were at the time of the census and whether they could read or write.</p>
											<p class="body"> Forms B1 and B2 collect information concerning the household's or individual's dwelling. Here you see the type of house, the number of rooms and windows, the material it was made of, whether it was rented, the name of the tenant, as well as whether it had any attached buildings such as a stable or a farmyard. </p>
											<p class="body"> The last form, 'Form N', collects data on the number of dwellings in the street or area and the number of inhabitants in them. The records are sorted and can be searched by surname, first name, town, county and even by age approximation in the census year. </p>
										<p class="red">IrishGenealogy.ie</p>
											<p class="body"><span class="image left"><img src="images\Irshgenealogy.png" alt="" /></span> <a href="https://www.irishgenealogy.ie/en/">IrishGenealogy.ie</a> is owned and operated by the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sports and Media. The website digitally preserves historical indexes to Civil Registers of births, marriages, civil partnerships, and deaths from across the island, as well as ecclesiastical records of baptisms, marriages, and burials from selected counties in Ireland. In total the site has over 15.5 million civil records. </p>
											<p class="body"> Civil registers are official state records that are maintained by the General Register Office (GRO). The records currently online include birth records for the period from 1864 to 1920, marriage records for the years from 1845 to 1945 and deaths from 1871 to 1970. All of these are stored on the website in the form of a digitised photograph of the original record. </p>
											<p class="body"> All these records include useful and interesting genealogical information. In a birth register, the child's full name, sex, date and place of birth, parents' names and surnames, the father's occupation and the name of the informant can be obtained. The marriage register gives the names and surnames of the spouses, the date of marriage, their place of residence before marriage and the father's name, surname and residence.  The name, surname and residence of the mother are usually available for registers in large cities. In the death register you can find out the name and surname of the deceased, sex, marital status, age, occupation, date, place and cause of death and the name of the informant. </p>
											<p class="body"> The website offers the possibility to search the registers using one or more of the fields listed in the previous paragraph. </p>
										<p class="red">National Library of Ireland</p>
											<p class="body"><span class="image left"><img src="images\National_Library.png" alt="" /></span>In 2015 the National Library of Ireland (NLI) launched a genealogical web portal, <a href="https://registers.nli.ie/">registers.nli.ie</a>, which has published parish records from 1740 to 1880. The NLI collects over 370,000 digital photographs of records from 1086 parishes in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, including baptisms, marriages and deaths. It is an important source for genealogical study as for most Irish people living during the 18th and 19th centuries it is the only surviving record of their existence (National Library of Ireland, 2017).</p>
											<p class="body"> Unlike the previous registers, these are more difficult to navigate. They are not sorted by name or surname but are organised by County and parish. When you choose a parish, you have to search through all the photographs in the original manuscript registers to find the ancestor. The quality and information in the registers varies from parish to parish. From a baptism register you can find, apart from the name of the child and the date, the names of the parents and godparents. From a marriage register one can get, in addition to the general information, the names of the witnesses.</p>

								<section id="The Research Process" class="main">
									<h2>The Research Process</h2>
										<p class="body">The first step was to talk to close family to gather basic information about the older generations and to start putting together a family tree. Talking to older relatives, such as grandparents, aunts, uncles or great aunts, is very useful as they tend to have memories and details of distant relatives. This provided a starting point with names and places going back to great-grandparents (4th generation), and to some extent to great-great-grandparents (5th generation).</p>
										<p class="body">The next step was to go to the National Archives website and consult the 1901 and 1911 censuses to find those relatives and additional information about those relatives. From the Census, you can obtain the names of direct relatives, as well as the area and county in which they lived. The Census records also give approximate ages, from which you can calculate the birth years of each ancestor. It also mentions whether a relative was widowed, which gives clues as to the possible years of death. If a surname is not common or may have different spelling, it will often be spelt incorrectly or vary from one Census to another. This also gives indications about how it might have been spelt in birth, marriage or death records.</p>
										<p class="body">The third step was to search the various records on irishgenealogy.ie. To further expand the family tree, the most important documents to find are the marriage records, as these contain the full names of one or both parents of the spouses. Birth and death certs are also needed to complete the tree. It is necessary to know at least one parent's name in order to find the correct birth certificate, as there may be different people sharing the same name. Death records are the most difficult to approve. It is easy to confirm a relative when the informant's signature is in the family; usually they were signed by a spouse or a son or daughter, but it gets complicated when you don't know whose signature it is.</p>
										<p class="body">The last area to be reviewed was the Parish Registers at the National Library, in order to complete the information on relatives from the mid-1800s and to further expand the tree to find new ancestors from the early 1800s.This process can be long and tedious as it involves searching through entire parish books, which are handwritten and can be difficult to read, from every parish in the area you might imagine the individual was in order to find who and what is being sought.</p>
										<p class="body">The last step involves going back to the different resources to cross-check the information. This is an repetitive process that involves going back to it again and again to fill in the missing gaps.</p>

								<section id="Data Collection" class="main">	
									<h2>Data Storage</h2>
										<p class="body"><span class="image right"><img src="images\Pedigree_Sheet.png" alt="" /></span> The data collected was originally stored in different Word files as Pedigree Sheets.</p>
										<p class="body"><i>A family <b>Pedigree Sheet</b>, also known as a person's family tree, the following fields are filled in: first and last name, date and place of birth, date and place of marriage and date and place of death for each direct relative of each generation starting with oneself (the individual, one's parents, grandparents, great-grandparents, great-great-grandparents, and so on).</i></p>
										<p class="body">There were a total of 5 Pedigree sheets, each containing a number of individuals. These sheets let you visualise the relationships in the family, but are not practical to work with. Census information is not represented on a Pedigree sheet; therefore, they were saved as PDF files in different folders. </p>

									<h2>MySQL Database</h2>
										<p class="body">I wanted to find a way to properly store the data so it would be more functional. To be able to quickly add, modify, filter, or find the information needed. I also wanted to practice designing and building a database using SQL.  </p>
										<p class="body">Once the database was finalised it was connected to Excel for further efficiency. With it being a small database having it on Excel gives you the chance to quickly filter and find the information needed visually.</p>
										<p class="body">After different tries, the Final model looked like this:</p>

								<section id="Data Visualisation" class="main">
									<h2>Data Visualisation</h2>
									<p class="body">For this project I wanted to create an interactive dashboard that would show the individuals movements throughout their lives (all the places where they have been), as well as all the extra information collected about them (dates, ages, occupation, etc). For that I used Power BI. </p>
									<p class="body">Finalised dashboard:</p>

									<h2>About The Dashboard</h2>
									<p class="body">The different elements used to be able to create the dashboard and display the most possible data where maps, tables, tooltips, cards, filters, bookmarks and buttons.</p>
									<h3>Map</h3>
									<p class="body">There are two map views, depending on the view you are one there are different filtering options.</p>
									<div class= "table-wrapper">

										<tbody>
											<tr>
												<td><b>Map by Individual</b></td>
												<td>The points on the map are coloured depending on the person it belongs to.</td>
											</tr>
											<tr>
												<td><b>Map by Event</b></td>
												<td>The points on the map are coloured by event (Birth, Death, Marriage, Census 1901 and Census 1911).</td>
											</tr>
										</table>
									<h3>Table</h3>
									<p class="body">The table shows:</p>
									<div class= "table-wrapper">
										<table class="alt">
										<tbody>
											<tr>
												<td><b>Generation</b></td>
												<td>Generations are counted starting with oneself. The father or mother is the second generation, the grandfather or grandmother represents the third generation, and so on.</td>

									<h3>Family Tree Image</h3>
									<p class="body">With the table alone it is not easy to see how everyone fits into the family. For that purpose I decided to include an image of the family tree that you can see by clicking on the tree button.</p>
									<span class="image fit"><img src="images\Dashboard_Tree.png" alt="" /></span>
									<h3>Filter Panels</h3>
									<p class="body">There are different filter panels depending on the map view you are on.</p>
									<span class="image fit"><img src="images\Filter_Panel.png" alt="" /></span>
									<h3>Tooltip</h3>
									<p class="body">The Tooltip contains all the relevant information of the individual , corresponding to the specific point on the map, that does not appear on the table.</p>
									<p class="body">It specifies the full name of the individual (née refering to the maiden name), the event, the age, occupation and maritial status at the time, and the location information.</p>
